<p><strong>Question (FueledByTesla): </strong> What's the weirdest thing you've ever done in office?  Like actually in your office.  </p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Undressed after being in drag on Gay Pride. Taking a shower only to find out the shower didn't work. And sometimes I like to go out on the balcony when the pond is frozen and some children are playing on the ice and yell: "This is private property! Go away or I'm calling the police!"</p>

<p><strong>Question (black-sun-rising): </strong> In Austin TX USA we also had Anarchists running for city council. Do you agree that you can still philosophically be an anarchist while working inside the system to try and improve things now?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> Yes, I still consider myself to be an anarchist. Or libertarian socialist like Chomsky calls it. For me it's first and most a job. I am not an anarchist because it's the perfect political theory. I am an anarchist because there is no such thing as the perfect political theory. What has affected my anarchistic ideas most is the internet. And maybe there will rise a new idea of neo anarchism and I think and I hope that some sort of anarconomy will be the economic system of the future.</p>
